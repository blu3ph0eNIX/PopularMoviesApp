**IMPORTANT: PLEASE REMOVE YOUR API KEY WHEN SHARING CODE PUBLICALLY**

If you ever upload your code to a public Github repo to share with 
other students or instructors, it’s illegal to include your personal 
themoviedb.org API key. Please remove it and note in a README where 
it came from, so someone else trying to run your code can create their 
own key and will quickly know where to put it. Instructors and code 
reviewers will expect this behavior for any public Github code.
